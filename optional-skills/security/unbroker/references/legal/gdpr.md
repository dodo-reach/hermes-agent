# GDPR / UK-GDPR (Art. 17 erasure + Art. 21 objection + Charter Art. 8)

For EU/UK subjects. Citations ground every request the skill sends.

## Rights invoked

The skill files under three EU Charter / GDPR articles that compose a complete legal basis:

- **Article 17 GDPR — Right to erasure** ("right to be forgotten"). The subject's primary lever.
  Erasure must be carried out without undue delay and in any event within one month (Article 12(3)).
- **Article 21 GDPR — Right to object**. Sends in parallel with Art. 17. Forces the broker to
  demonstrate "compelling legitimate grounds that override" the subject's interests — a bar
  commercial data-broking of named individuals rarely clears (see EDPB Guidelines on legitimate
  interest, three-part test).
- **Article 8, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union — Protection of personal
  data**. The constitutional anchor. Quoting it in the request signals to the broker's legal
  team that this is not a routine suppression request — it is a fundamental-rights claim.

For UK residents post-Brexit, the same rights are retained verbatim under the **UK GDPR**
(Data Protection Act 2018, retained EU law). The Article 12(3) deadline, the Article 83 fine
ceiling, and the Article 77 complaint procedure all apply via the ICO.

The Art. 17 / 21 request templates lead with the rights and ask for erasure. The Art. 77 DPA
complaint templates cite those as the prior request and ask the supervisory authority to enforce.

## When to use which request kind

The skill picks via `legal.render_request(kind, broker, fields)`:

- **`gdpr`** (default) — the Art. 17 + 21 combined request, for any broker holding the subject's
  personal data with a privacy contact addressable by email or web form.
- **`gdpr_art21_only`** — for brokers where the legitimate-interest claim is strong (public
  records, phone directories with strong publisher-side grounds). Leads with Art. 21 objection
  and only mentions erasure as a fallback.
- **`gdpr_indirect`** — for cases where the subject's PII sits on a third party's record (the
  "subject appears on someone else's profile" case). Mirrors the CCPA `ccpa_indirect` shape.
- **`generic`** — fallback when the broker's `optout.deletion.kinds` does not include `gdpr`
  (rare; the `request_kind()` dispatcher in `autopilot.py` enforces this restriction).

## Per-broker routing

The `brokers.gdpr_scope()` filter returns the set of brokers an EU subject can reasonably
expect to honour Art. 17 (US brokers with a track record + all EU-native brokers under
`references/brokers/eu/`). Brokers with `gdpr_scope: false` are skipped from the DPA-escalation
planner — the subject still files an Art. 17 against them (and the broker may still honour it),
but `pdd.py next` will not surface escalation actions for brokers unlikely to respond to a DPA.

Every curated US broker record now carries a `gdpr_scope` boolean and `jurisdictions` includes
`"EU"` alongside `"US"`. This means an EU subject sees their native brokers (Locasystem,
Pagine Bianche, etc.) AND the US brokers with documented Art. 17 paths (Spokeo, Whitepages,
etc.) in their `pdd.py plan` output.

## Request content

The rendered email always contains:

1. The Article(s) being invoked (17 / 21 / Charter Art. 8).
2. The data subject's name + contact email + (where required) address — **least-disclosure**;
   SSN and ID numbers are never volunteered.
3. The listing URL(s) the subject's data appears at.
4. A clear statement of what is required: written confirmation of erasure within 30 days,
   confirmation that data will not be re-acquired and re-processed, and (where applicable)
   disclosure of any third parties the data has been shared with (Article 15(1)(c)).
5. An escalation notice: if no satisfactory response is received within 30 days, the subject
   will lodge a complaint with their national supervisory authority under Article 77.

## Statutory deadlines

- **Article 12(3) GDPR**: controller must respond within **one month** of receipt, with an
  optional **two-month extension** for complex requests (the broker must notify the
  extension within the first month). Total possible window: **30 to 90 days**.
- **Article 78(2)**: supervisory authority must act on a complaint within a reasonable time,
  typically 3 months.
- **Article 83(5)**: administrative fines up to **EUR 20 million or 4% of total worldwide
  annual turnover**, whichever is higher, for infringements of the basic principles
  (including Art. 5, 6, 7, 9, 22, 44, 45, 46).

## The Article 77 escalation path (DPA complaints)

When an Art. 17 request is filed and the broker does not respond within the 30-day Article 12(3)
window, the subject can file an Article 77 complaint with their national supervisory authority.
This is the legal step CCPA has no equivalent for — and the killer feature of the EU pipeline.

`pdd.py escalate <subject> <broker>` renders a complaint in the DPA's working language (Italian
for Garante, French for CNIL, German for BfDI, English for ICO and the generic fallback). The
complaint cites the prior Art. 17 request date and asks the DPA to enforce under Article 58(2).

`pdd.py next` surfaces this **automatically** 35+ days after an Art. 17 was filed with no
response (35 = 30-day Art. 12(3) clock + 5-day grace for time-zone and clock-skew). The
subject reviews the rendered draft, attaches the prior Art. 17 evidence + a copy of their ID,
files with the DPA via PEC (Italy), web form (UK, France, Germany), or post, then runs
`pdd.py escalate <subject> <broker> --file` to stop the autonomous queue from re-surfacing.

See `references/legal/dpa-escalation.md` for the full per-DPA procedure.

## Notes on specific jurisdictions

- **Germany (federal)**: BfDI handles federal bodies and telecom. Most data-broker complaints
  against private-sector controllers go to the **Land** DPA of the subject's residence
  (16 Land DPAs). The BfDI adapter ships a generic complaint that notes this and asks the
  authority to forward to the correct Land DPA.
- **Italy**: filing via **PEC** (protocollo@pec.gpdp.it) is the strongest paper trail and
  preferred by the Garante for any complaint that may later escalate to court. The web form
  is the no-PEC fallback.
- **France (CNIL)**: CNIL is one of the most enforcement-active DPAs in the EU (Clearview AI
  fine, etc.). Their complaint procedure is well-documented and accessible.
- **UK (ICO)**: ICO retains Article 17 / Article 21 rights verbatim under the UK GDPR.
  Post-Brexit case law: the April 2024 Upper Tribunal ruling in the Experian case narrowed some
  of ICO's powers; the current ICO guidance reflects the post-ruling position.

## What is out of scope (call out in PR body)

- Brazil (LGPD), Switzerland (nDSG/revFADP), and other non-EU/UK jurisdictions.
- Automated web-form submission of Garante/CNIL/ICO/BfDI complaint forms (first version
  renders + saves the complaint text; browser-form automation is a follow-up).
- Subject residency codes without shipped DPA adapters (EU-ES, NL, BE, AT, IE, PT, PL, SE,
  DK, FI) — the subject files via the generic English template. Adapters for these are
  follow-up work.
- Article 20 (data portability) and Article 15 (right of access) request templates — same
  engine, follow-up work.

## Disclaimer

This is not legal advice. The cite ladder is grounded in the published text of the GDPR,
the EDPB Guidelines, and the EU Charter. A subject with non-trivial exposure (sensitive
data, ongoing harassment, pre-litigation posture) should consult a privacy lawyer in their
jurisdiction before filing.
